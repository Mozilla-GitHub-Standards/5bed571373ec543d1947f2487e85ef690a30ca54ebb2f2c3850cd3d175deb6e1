<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>As announced at today&#8217;s Mozilla Project meeting, I&#8217;m happy to welcome <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~faaborg/index.htm">Alex Faaborg</a> to our motley crew here at Mozilla. I met Alex after a <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~faaborg/files/thesis/draft/complete/semanticSearch.html">presentation</a> he made at CHI 2006 in Montreal, and am quite thrilled to have him join our team.</p>

<p>Alex is going to be helping us continue to develop perhaps the most important aspect of our products: the user experience. He&#8217;ll be helping project teams understand what they can learn from new and existing research in the field of human computer interaction, and how they can use that information to innovate and change the way people interact with the web. We&#8217;ve got his sights set on <a href="http://labs.mozilla.org">Mozilla Labs</a>, of course, but you should also expect to see him on IRC (as <tt>faaborg</tt>), in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox">dev.apps.firefox</a>, in <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">bugzilla</a>, and of course, on <a href="http://faablogborg.blogspot.com/">his weblog</a>.</p>

<p>Please join me in welcoming Alex to Mozilla!</p></p>

<p>When someone says they’ve identified a vulnerability, we treat it as real until we can verify otherwise.  We immediately begin investigating and trying to fix it.  This is how we’re able to ship fixes so quickly.</p>
<p>At Toorcon this weekend, two speakers claimed they found vulnerabilities in the Javascript VM.  Of course we take that very seriously.</p>
<p>So far we’ve been able to reproduce a denial of service issue based on the information they gave during their talk.  In some cases this causes a crash based on an out of memory error.  Based on the information we have at this time we have not been able to confirm whether an attacker can achieve code execution.  We’re still investigating and we’ll keep you updated.</p>

<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>We had a bit of an outage last week. Our beloved <a href="http://litmus.mozilla.org/">Litmus</a> fell over last week as the server it was hosted on had an aneurysm and fell over in its rack. Many thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/zach/archives/017001.html">Zach</a> and <a href="http://coop.deadsquid.com/?p=600">Coop</a> for getting it back up and running and for posting the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla_QA_Community:BonEcho_2.0RC1prerelease_Community_Test_Day#Results">results</a> from the previous week&#8217;s testday which I&#8217;d neglected to post that weekend (and, in fact, couldn&#8217;t post anyway because I lacked Coop&#8217;s script-running technology – welcome back, Coop!).</p>
<p>What are FFTs? <em>Full-functional tests</em> are a classification of tests that cover as much of a particular feature or application area as possible. They are a superset of BFTs, or <em>basic functional tests</em> which, in turn, are a broader range of tests than the most-basic <em>smoketests</em>: the first level of certification completed to move an app to a wider testing audience.</p>
<p>Typically, when a new build is being prepared for release, we would go through a round of smoketests, then the BFTs and finally throw the book at it with the FFTs. You can view the different and many FFTs in Litmus, either by group or <a href="http://litmus.mozilla.org/show_test.cgi?type=by_category&amp;product=1&amp;testgroup=27&amp;subgroup=">in full</a> (Firefox 2.0 shown).</p>
<p>So, as the Firefox 2.0 RC2 builds are being readied, we&#8217;ll be moving through these different testing stages and culminating in another testday this coming Friday where you&#8217;re all invited to come out and run some FFTs with us. We&#8217;ll be announcing the focus for this week&#8217;s testday later in the week as we figure out which areas of the &#8216;fox need the most attention. For a historical retrospective and a look at what&#8217;s coming for RC2, checkout the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:2.0_QA_Activities">Firefox:2.0_QA_Activities</a> wiki page.</p>
<p>One other note, tomorrow is bugday. Join Marcia, Tracy and a cast of dozens in their on-going quest to hunt the wild bug in #bugday on <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla_QA_Community:BonEcho_2.0RC1prerelease_Community_Test_Day#Where_do_I_start.3F">irc.mozilla.org</a>. Stay-tuned for the word on testday.

<h3><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/" title="Hacking for Christ">Gervase Markham</a></h3>

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2006/10/dns_structure.html">DNS Structure</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>Almost since the beginning of the Mozilla project, there have been <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9422">various</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252342">bugs</a> open on the browser about cookies, domain names and privacy, caused by the differing models of delegation in use around the world. Essentially, Firefox does not know that you should be allowed to set a cookie for "amazon.com", but not for "co.uk" at the same level of the DNS. This allows unscrupulous advertisers to track people across multiple otherwise-independent sites.</p>

<p>In one sense, this is by design. The DNS system is not supposed to impose any rules about how subdomains can be delegated. However, this flexibility clearly causes a problem in this case. The <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">original cookie spec</a> rather glossed over the problem, by suggesting a "one dot rule" - don't allow the cookie if the domain attribute has no dots. This is fine for .com, but doesn't help for .co.uk. The <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt">second attempt</a> had another go at defining a rule which worked in practice, but there were still loopholes.</p>

<p>Various solutions have been <a href="http://my.opera.com/yngve/blog/show.dml/267415">proposed</a> for this problem - from <a href="http://files.myopera.com/yngve/blog/draft-pettersen-subtld-structure-00.txt">making the information available as a web service</a>, to <a href="http://files.myopera.com/yngve/blog/draft-pettersen-dns-cookie-validate-00.txt">doing DNS lookups</a> to see if the name resolves, to <a href="http://my.opera.com/yngve/blog/show.dml/388840">writing a new cookie spec</a>, to making an enormous list encoding the delegation structure of every one of the 200+ TLDs on the planet.</p>

<p>This last has always seemed like a Sisyphean task. One person <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252342#c31">worked out</a> what the rules were for Japan; they seemed so complicated that no-one wanted to take on the job of doing the same thing 199 more times. However, spurred by the need for Places to also know this information in order to present your history and bookmarks to you in a sensible fashion, the indefatigable Jo Hermans took up the challenge. Attached to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342314">bug 342314</a>, you can see the first version of a document which attempts to record all of this information.</p>

<p>Although in the past, Japan was used to justify the "this is too complex; it'll never work" argument, it turns out that the Norwegians take the prize for the most complicated delegation system. Encoding it correctly requires 760 rules. TLDs like .net, on the other hand, have just one - or none, if you rely on the fact that single-part domain names are implied members of the list.</p>

<p>So, thanks to Jo's hard work, Firefox 3 will have a more secure cookie implementation. We will be sharing this information with Opera, and any other browser maker who may find it useful. It's important to note that this information changes over time; applications should only ship this file if they have some way to update it.<br />

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2006/10/a_builder_in_a_build_land.html">A Builder in a Build Land</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>While sitting here, waiting for the Firefox 2.0 RC 2 candidates to finish compiling (go <strike>Win32</strike> SpeedRacer!!), I started thinking about <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2006/09/ahead_of_the_release_curve_iv.html">that post</a> I wrote (has it <i>already been</i>?!) two weeks ago.</p>

<p>After re-reading it, I to fire up Google to scour the blogosphere to see if anyone else is writing about this stuff.  "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=build%2Frelease+engineering+blog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Build/Release Engineering blog</a>" seemed like a good place to start.</p>

<p>The picking were pretty slim, with the first twenty or so results all posts referring to build/release engineers, job pages (including a cache of MoCo's old Careers page), and feed links to... well... <i>my</i> blog.</p>

<p>That's... uhh... real useful there.</p>

<p>Next I tried "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=build+engineering+blog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">build engineering blog</a>," which pointed me at <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/">Make Magazine's</a> blog and a bunch of Google API documentation? Hrm... alright.</p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=release+engineering+blog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Release engineering blog</a>" doesn't get us any closer, providing a weird combination of content from "build engineering blog" and random posts complaining about release dates of various products slipping.</p>

<p>Changing my search trajectory, I tried "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=8lL&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=scm+blog&amp;btnG=Search">scm blog</a>." I guess the business majors' "SCM" is more popular than mine.</p>

<p>All in all, I managed to find <a href="http://releasemanagement.wordpress.com">two</a> <a href="http://damonpoole.blogspot.com/">lighthouses</a> in the Supply Chain Management-dominated sea.</p>

<center>***</center>
I've said it before, but I really enjoy <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel On Software</a>.

<p>The most engaging aspect of his essays is how they prompt me to consider subjects I normally wouldn't. Sure, a lot of the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000049.html">Win32-specific stuff</a> he discusses every so often isn't directly applicable to my daily hacking-life, but most of it, including his treatises on scheduling and the other "soft stuff," apply in a "build land." Admittedly, the wavelength is often... a few degrees out of phase, so it does require some mental modulation.</p>

<p>But that probably isn't the most <i>valuable</i> aspect of his writings: I don't always agree with him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he writes about Microsoft with a nostalgic flare that would choke a anti-trust judge. And I can't say that I'm impressed with his constant reference to Netscape's "<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">huge mistake</a>.<sup>1</sup>"</p>

<p>But whether or not you agree, this valus is in <b>pushing the discourse forward</b>. Making others form their own opinions, translating to their own sandboxes as necessary, should never be underestimated.</p>

<p>And honestly, I've never seen a man&mdash;to say nothing of a <i>software engineer</i>&mdash;<a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">squee</a> so much about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/OfficeNewYork.html">his office space [re]design</a>.</p>

<p>I just love it.</p>

<center>***</center>
While creating a <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/preed_on_buildrelease_engineer/">new Movable Type category thingy</a>, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had heard that word somewhere.

<p>I asked a friend what he thought of when I said it, and he said "Oh, that's like 'poor little boy' in Spanish."</p>

<p>Urban Dictionary is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pobrecito">less charitable</a>, but as for the subject matter discussed herein, probably more accurate.</p>

<p>What I have yet to figure out is whether it refers to the author... or the reader(s?). </p>

<p>I guess you'll have to tell me.</p>

<p>And while you're at it, feel free to pass along any Google-fu on finding more lighthouses to be looking out for.</p>

<p><small><small>_______________________<br />
<sup>1</sup> I go back and forth on that one; the truth is probably somewhere in between...</small></small></p></p>

<h4><a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/archives/2006/10/01/120/">Redmond, Pt. 1</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>A few of us are visiting the Vista Compatibility Lab here in Redmond for the next day or two; I just managed to get on the wireless network at the hotel after fighting with getting Vista to unsuspend my laptop.  (I don&#8217;t know whether to laugh or to cry that even Vista can&#8217;t reliably suspend/unsuspend; there&#8217;s probably no hope for Linux.)  We hope to get a chance to talk to People Who Know &#8482; about all sorts of issues surrounding Vista, including figuring out how to work with limited user accounts and UAC, various compatibility issues, and how to take advantage of certain Vista integration opportunities.</p>

<p>For me, I hope to figure out what the state of 2D rendering is within Vista <a rel="tag" target="_new" href="http://blog.vlad1.com/archives/2006/09/25/113/">as I blogged about a few days ago</a>, and to get some input on which direction we should head for getting the best possible 2D rendering from Vista, without resorting to Direct3D/OpenGL.</p>

<p>If the answer ends up being Direct3D, so be it; we can certainly do that, but I was hoping for something a little easier to work with.  Essentially, there are a few different layers that we can hook into:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>High-level path rendering layer.  This is a layer similar to the interface that Cairo provides us; rendering is done in terms of strokes and fills of arbitrary paths, with any choice of source for the operation (usually: a solid color; another surface, with optional repeat and transforms like scale; or a gradient).  This happens to be the layer that Quartz exposes for us, though with some limitation on source.  GDI+ has an API similar to this, but GDI+ is dead (or so it seems &#8212; maybe it got ressurected and hardware accelerated in Vista while noone was looking?).  WPF certainly can do all this stuff, but the only APIs are all .NET and are often retained mode, which is not appropriate for us. </p></li>
<li><p>Surface compositing layer.  The system has no concept of paths or filling/stroking, but does know how to composite surfaces.  The common Porter-Duff compositing operators, SRC and OVER, but with and without a mask, should be hardware accelerated and supported for surfaces both with and without alpha as either the source or destination.  Ideally, the system would also know how to transform and filter surfaces, and should be able to apply different filters (e.g. nearest-neighbour, bilinear, gaussian, etc) to the source image during a transform/resampling operation to satisfy different quality/performance tradeoffs.  Paths would generally be rendered either as masks or as solid colors and then composited onto the destination.</p></li>
<li><p>Bitmap data layer.  The system doesn&#8217;t do much else other than let you poke at bits directly.  There is often a fast way to move data from one surface to another, assuming that they are of identical types (a memcpy, essentially).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, the Windows backend works at somewhere between the last two layers; most complex operations are done using software fallbacks, but we can do fast surface composites in some cases, using AlphaBlend().  No (useful) masking is supported, so any complex path rendering has to take a slow pure software route.  I would like to find out what, if anything, we can do with Vista to get us at least to having full accelerated compositing capabilities without having to special case the world like we do with GDI.  We&#8217;ll see what I find out!</p>

<h4><a href="http://kveton.com/blog/2006/09/30/yahoo-browser-based-authentication/">Yahoo! Browser-Based Authentication</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>Yahoo! announced yesterday that they are <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/">opening up</a> their authentication mechanisms so that you can get access to users&#8217; data stored in Yahoo (with their permission of course) as well as leverage account information for single sign-on.  They offered up some PHP example code and have even opened it up further than Google has with their efforts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to say it: this is fantastic.  I know, I know.  I&#8217;m reading a bunch of notes on the identity gang mailing list about how bad this is going to be or how this isn&#8217;t really open (just deepening the silo).  I think some of that is true but in the grand scheme of things this is a fantastic step in the right direction.</p>
<p>With the emergence of technologies like <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a> and InfoCard its clear that there are some excellent technological solutions to the concept of user-centric identity.  My biggest concern is that Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft join forces and do a federation between their sites (and only their sites).  If I still have to keep all of my data in any one of those places, its no worse than me only being able to get cable, phone and Internet from a very few providers (read: monopolies).  Could that happen?  Dunno.  I don&#8217;t think its likely with the way things are shaping up between Google and Microsoft; those two companies are way to competitive to collaborate on something like this.</p>
<p>It really would be great if instead of deepening their silo, Yahoo! had instead chosen to use OpenID.  I do think people are still a little weary of this new technology.  I get it time and again when I see the rolling of the eyes and the ole&#8217; &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; look on people&#8217;s faces when I tell them about it.  That said, every day the momentum is continuing to pick up.  I see more and more sites adopting it, the use of our identity provider platform is just exploding and there is a palpable shift as we&#8217;re approaching a tipping point.  Is it ready for a Yahoo!?  Probably not quite yet.  6 months and we&#8217;ll be there.  And guess what?  Both Yahoo! and Google are getting closer to what we really want which is a truly open, decentralized, user-centric system for identity management.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to crawl before you can walk.

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2006/09/sunbirdlightning_03_release_ca.html">Status update (30 September)</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
Hey folks,
I'm very sorry for not updating this blog earlier, but we were so busy in getting the 0.3 release in a decent shape, that I simply forgot to do it. As you can see from the list of fixed bugs that follows, the developers have been working very hard on getting the builds ready for release and we're very near (probably within the next 2-3 days) to a first release candidate, which can then be tested on our Calendar test day (see the <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2006/09/upcoming_calendar_test_day.html">previous post</a>).

<h4><a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/archives/2006/09/30/119/">Visualizing Performance</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>One of the difficulties in figuring out just how much slower or faster we are than previous versions of Firefox (or of other browsers) is finding useful ways to compare results.  The usual test of choice is a page layout test, which times how long it takes from the start of a page load until the onload handler fires.  Our tinderboxes run this test constantly over a pageset (an ancient one, but that&#8217;s not relevant for this) of about 40 pages.  We take a number of samples and then calculate the mean pageload time for each page.  Then we take all of those values and calculate a single Tp value, which is what&#8217;s displayed on the tinderbox page, and what is most easily accessible using the historical graph data.</p>

<p>The problem is, the Tp value can be misleading or be a flat out lie.  If you check in a patch where you speed up 39 out of the 40 pages by 5%, but the 40th page you slow down by a factor of 3-4 or something, you end up seeing a Tp spike on the tinderbox page.  Then everyone panics, and starts closing trees down, threatening you with being backed out, etc.  You can see the raw data (see, it&#8217;s right there, in the multi-megabyte tinderbox log, towards the end!), but it&#8217;s hard to compare it to another run.  So instead of realizing that your patch had an adverse effect on one specific page, giving you something you can then run through a profiler, you&#8217;re generally stuck trying to figure out why that single number went up.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about implementing some sort of graphical display that gives more information about the test runs, and a few hours ago I decided to see if i could put something together.  I&#8217;ve been using the Tp2 test that runs off the local disk for a lot of testing, so I had put together a simple app that takes two chunks of JS strings that I modified the Tp2 test to output after each run, and creates a comparison table.  I took that app and started adding some simple graphing capability.  The first bit was a simple line graph, one line per data set, and one point per page:</p>

<p><center><img width="300" src="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/misc/perf-work/s3.png" /></center></p>

<p>(In case you&#8217;re wondering, this is comparing Bon Echo to Minefield, under Vista RC1 on my laptop.  In the graph above, Minefield is in blue, Bon Echo is in red; in later graphs, the value is the change from Bon Echo to Minefield.)  This test is fairly hardware sensitive, especially GPU and drivers, so the results here may or may not match what the tinderboxes or other runs show.  But that graph seems to show that we are in general a tiny bit slower in some cases, a tiny bit faster in others, and much, much slower in one or two specific pages.  (In this case, the big spike is the old voodooextreme page, which exercises certain text measurement bits that could be taking a much faster path than they are now.)  If we had boiled down these runs to a single value, we would see that Minefield was slower &#8212; but the &#8220;average&#8221; slowdown would appear to be much greater than it is, because it&#8217;s skewed by the one large spike.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to do <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&amp;topic_id=1">sparklines</a> in the tinderbox display for a while, so I tried graphing percentage slower or percentage faster as a sparkline: <img src="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/misc/perf-work/s7.png" />.  I think this looks pretty good, and would be something that I&#8217;d like to include in a performance dashboard that we&#8217;d like to set up on the tinderbox.  Also of interest would be a display with one sparkline per page in the Tp test, showing historical values for that particular page in the set.  We actually have this data stored along with the overall average Tp value in the database, it&#8217;s just not used by anything, nor is it directly queryable (the individual values are just stored as a single blob), so it would be possible to do this with full historical data.</p>

<p>An alternate way of displaying the percentage change might be something like:</p>

<p><center><img src="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/misc/perf-work/s4.png" /> <img src="http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/misc/perf-work/s6.png" /></center></p>

<p>The chart on the left just displays a simple binary slower/faster value, while the one on the right modules the color by the percentage difference.  Light gray indicates little or no change; the symbol becomes more saturated towards green or red as the relative speed of Minefield is faster or slower than Bon Echo.  We could pack more information into this, by adding on-hover information showing the page, actual values, and percentage change.  Clicking could take you to the detailed graph for that specific page in the pageset, where the Bonsai integration could give you information on commits which may have affected that value.  There are some problems with the color choice, though it works ok in the right graph.. in the left the negative space diamonds form a pretty powerful pattern, making it harder to see slower/faster.  The sparkline communicates this much better, though without the possibility for further digging of the data.</p>

<p>Those are just some ideas&#8230; I hope to have some kind of performance dashboard up in the next month or two, so that we can better track our progress for Gecko 1.9.</p>

<h4><a href="http://robert.accettura.com/archives/2006/09/29/google-reader-updated/">Google Reader Updated</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> Readers for a while, but not consistently because I&#8217;m extremely picky.  I <em>insist</em> on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to show multiple feeds merged together as 1 category.</li>
<li>Do the above, fast.</li>
<li>Handle <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> 2.0 and Atom without <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/04/15/feed-validator/">bugging out</a> over all the tiny mistakes or discrepancies some generators can have</li>
<li>Either be remotely hosted, or have a client capable of having an <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> or some other <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> remotely, so it&#8217;s accessible on more than 1 system.</li>
<li><acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> import/export (mandatory).</li>
<li>Free, preferably open source.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s client based, it can&#8217;t use 10,000 threads, and 100MB RAM, it needs to be somewhat small and quick.</li>
<li>Unobtrusive</li>
</ul>
<p>So far not many have even come close to this.  <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> is popular but royally stinks.  It&#8217;s awkward (just because you use &#8220;AJAX&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean your eloquently designed.  It&#8217;s also somewhat slow, and not application-like since it&#8217;s not fully JS driven.  I just can&#8217;t get comfortable to the design.  Not to mention, ewww frames?  Google Reader had this silly design (that scrolling concept) that was just awkward and inefficient use of screen space.  That&#8217;s not good for when I want to quickly read things.  Good layout is critical.</p>
<p>On the client side I evaluated several including Thunderbird (which I love for email), but it&#8217;s <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> support is extremely basic, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering it&#8217;s an email client.  Bottom line is Feeds aren&#8217;t emails and shouldn&#8217;t be displayed as such.  I also tried <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/">RSSOwl</a>, but it&#8217;s java based and still pretty clunky as a result.  I just couldn&#8217;t imagine keeping that open all day.  Next up was <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSSBandit</a>.  This isn&#8217;t bad (actually pretty good), but it isn&#8217;t updated often, it is very fussy in regards to feed validation issues, and is somewhat of a thread hog.  Not to mention it&#8217;s not very eloquent with refreshing feeds.  Rather than space them out it seems to do a large number all at once, which is somewhat of a system slow down.  The whole point is to be efficient.  I wasn&#8217;t to fond of using <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> as the internal browser either.  Adding feeds from Firefox was also painfully slow for some reason.  Still it was the best so far for my needs, and was the default for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html">Google Reader has been redesigned</a>, and it&#8217;s finally good enough for real use.  It&#8217;s new design is vastly superior to the last generation, though still has a few odd quirks.  It really needs to take a tip from Bloglines in regards to organizing/manging feeds, so that it&#8217;s not as much effort (go into prefs, in the subscriptions tab, scroll down to the feed you want, tag it).  The one thing Bloglines had right, Google Reader doesn&#8217;t have.  It also doesn&#8217;t send the right MimeType when exporting <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym>, but I suspect that will be fixed shortly.  It also requires this interstitial page before adding a feed (to select where to add it to), but doesn&#8217;t give you the option to select what tags to give it.  That&#8217;s pointless.  Other than that, it&#8217;s solid.  It&#8217;s now my default.  I&#8217;ll be using Firefox to preview feeds, and add them to Google Reader.  I can keep it open in 1 Firefox tab and monitor it just by the page title.</p>
<p>On a side note, how many years will it take before FedEx, UPS, DHL and USPS finally offer tracking via feed?  I know there are services for it, but they break when one of them updates, and I really don&#8217;t feel like giving another site my tracking number.

<div class="entry">
<p>
<div><p>This is my report on activities of the <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org/">Mozilla
Foundation</a> for the week ending
September 29, 2006.</p>

<h2>Projects for the week</h2>

<p>Here's a partial listing of what I and others at the Foundation did
this past week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>IP-related issues. I corresponded with <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/">Daniel Glazman</a> about the
naming of his proposed successor product to Mozilla Composer and
Nvu, and agreed to help him with trademark-related issues as
appropriate. I also got some paperwork completed relating to the
trademark application for the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/artwork.html">SeaMonkey logo</a>, and will be
proceeding with that.</p>

<p>I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank <a href="http://www.purportex.org/">Alex Butin</a>,
who created the SeaMonkey logo, and <a href="http://markcarson.com/">Mark Carson</a>, who created
the <a href="http://markcarson.com/MarkCarson/asp/SunbirdLogo.asp">Sunbird logo</a>, for their great work and generosity in
creating the logos and donating them to the Mozilla
Foundation. Please join me in thanking them both!</p>

<p>Next action(s): More trademark stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Conferences and other outreach. At <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/">EuroOSCON</a> Zak Greant
interviewed various folks with other open source and free software
projects to get a handle on their own issues and whether and how
the Mozilla Foundation might be able to assist them in future.
interally. Zak also represented the Mozilla Foundation at the
<a href="http://www.governmentciosummit.ca/index.php?id=159&amp;L=1">Government CIO Summit</a> in Ottawa on September 28 and talked
with various people about adoption of open source and free
software within government organizations in Canada and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Next action(s): Zak is looking to do more such interviews in the
future.</p></li>
<li><p>IDN. Gerv Markham was invited to speak on the Mozilla project's work
on Internationalized Domain Names at the <a href="http://www.igfgreece2006.gr/">Internet Governance
Forum meeting</a> in Athens Greece October 30 through November
2, but won't be able to attend due to his <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2006/09/radiotherapy_week_1.html">radiotherapy
treatments</a>. He's working to recruit someone to go in his stead.</p>

<p>Next action(s): If a volunteer can be found, arrange Foundation
sponsorship for their travel.</p></li>
<li><p>Mozilla meet-ups. Gerv has been discussing with various people the
possibility of having a European meeting sometime in 2007 for
localizers and other Mozilla contributors.</p>

<p>Next action(s): Talk with folks at the Corporation to see what if
any plans they have, and proceed accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Grants and related topics. Other than helping with arrangements for
the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility_Hackfest_2006">Mozilla accessibility summit</a>, not much went on last week.</p>

<p>Next action(s): Sort out administrative arrangements for one more
project we're planning to fund.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Upcoming activities</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I'll be in Cambridge MA on October 10 for one day of the Mozilla
accessibility summit.</p></li>
<li><p>Zak will be stopping by to visit at Mozilla HQ in Mountain View in
late October while he's in town for the <a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">Zend/PHP conference</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This concludes the report.</p>

<h3><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/" title="preed's blah-blah-blahg">J. Paul Reed</a></h3>

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/preed/2006/09/sometimes_i_dont_understand_vm.html">Sometimes, I don't understand VMware at all</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p><tt>pacifica-vm</tt>, which most of you probably know as the Firefox 2 Windows nightly build machine, has had an interesting week.</p>

<p>Last week, I took the machine down to back up its virtual disk image, increase the amount of RAM available to it, and, in an attempt to decrease the cycle-time, added a VMware virtual-CPU to the VM, increasing it to two.</p>

<p>This didn't really have the intended effect. Cycle times for both nightly and depend builds <b>went up</b> by about 15%.</p>

<p>Thinking that maybe the build system wasn't making as efficient usage of its shiny new virtual CPU as it could, I upped make's <tt>-j</tt> value from 3 to 4. This reduced cycle times... to what they were <i>before</i> the memory/CPU "upgrade," but also had the useful side-effect that make would hang every few builds, including most notably on nightly builds. (That is, incidentally, why nightly builds on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday were all late; make kept hanging overnight with <tt>-j4</tt>.)</p>

<p>Finally, last night, I removed the second VCPU, but kept the extra memory and higher <tt>-j</tt> values.</p>

<p><i>That</i> change not only made the machine start reliably producing nightlies again (or, at least, make stopped hanging), but it took the cycle time down to 40 minutes for a depend cycle, and 2ish hours for a nightly build. (Interestingly enough, that full build value seems to fluctuate anywhere from about 90 minutes to just over a couple of hours; I think this is because the trunk build machine and the 1.8 build machine are on the same VM box, and they're both starting their nightlies at the same time, which slows both of them down a bit.)</p>

<p>So, to recap here:</p>

<center><table border="1"><tr><th> </th><th>Nightly Build</th><th>Depend Build</th></tr>
<tr><td>Before changes</td><td>~ 2 hours</td><td>~1 hour</td></tr>
<tr><td>After memory/CPU "upgrade"</td><td>~ 2 hours, 20 minutes</td><td>~ 1 hour, 15 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>After adding <tt>-j4</tt></td><td>~2 hours; hung often</td><td>1 hour; hung often</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remove one VCPU</td><td>~ 2 hours; jury still out, though</td><td>40 minutes</td></tr></table></center>
Things I've learned from this experience:

<ul><li>Linking Firefox, especially on Win32, takes memory. <b>A lot</b> of memory. In the couple of trials I paid attention to, it took around 700 megs. Seeing as the VM had 700 megs, a large part of the problem seemed to be the machine descending into swapping thrash-hell when trying to do the final link.</li>
<li>Win32 SMP = Teh suck. I had actually learned this from previous experiences in previous lives, but... a reminder is always good.</li>
<li>When you actually pay attention to VMs, and spend some time "tuning" them&mdash;which in this case, amounted to creating a better match between the memory profile for the machine's task and the virtual hardware&mdash;VMs don't perform all <i>that</i> badly, relatively to physical hardware. <tt>gaius-vm</tt>, for instance, has horrible cycle times compared to gaius, but it's not "just because it's a <tt>-vm</tt>." It's because no one's paid enough attention to it after migrating it to tune it. (No, I haven't taken what I've learned here and applied to gaius.)</li>
<li>Once again, sometimes... VMware['s performance] continues to <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/justin/2006/07/so_i_need_parallels_to_run_vmw.html">confuse the hell</a> out of me.</li></ul></p>

<h4><a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2006-09-29/recursive-make-isnt-all-that-bad/">Recursive Make Isn&#8217;t All That Bad</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>In 1998, Peter Miller wrote an essay <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug87.pdf">Recursive Make Considered Harmful (PDF)</a>. He outlines several convincing arguments for why the traditional practice of recursing through directories and calling <tt>make</tt> in each directory may not be a good technique.</p>
<p>Mozilla uses recursive <tt>make</tt> extensively. In fact, during a typical build we traverse each directory in the build tree at least twice, and in some cases three or even four times. So, way back in 2002, Chris Seawood <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=RMCH">filed a bug</a> to reduce the number of subdirectories we traverse during a typical build. This had the promise of significantly reducing build time on Windows because forking processes on Windows (and especially under cygwin) is really expensive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that a non-recursive <tt>make</tt> was taking <em>longer</em> than the standard recursive <tt>make</tt>. I thought, at the time, that this was due to the use of extra $(shell cygpath) subprocesses needed to handle sources from multiple subdirectories correctly. About a month ago, at <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/schrep/">schrep</a>&#8217;s prompting, I went back to see whether there was a way to get it working. The results are below:</p>
<table class="data" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="3"><tt>make -C netwerk libs</tt><br />(Nothing to rebuild)</th></tr></thead></table>
<tr>
<th>
<th>Standard (recursive) make</th></th></tr>
<th><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=236499">Non-recursive make</a></th>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>real</th></tr></tbody>
<td>5.64s</td>
<td>7.36s</td>
<tr>
<th>user</th></tr>
<td>6.50s</td>
<td>1.17s</td>
<tr>
<th>sys</th></tr>
<td>3.31s</td>
<td>1.96s<br />
</td>
<p>It turns out that the problem with non-recursive make, at least as I currently have it coded, is not the cost of forking processes, but the cost of statting files that don&#8217;t exist. Every time a makefile adds a directory to <code><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/VPATH">VPATH</a></code>, make ends up searching through additional directories looking for files. As you can see from the chart, the actual processor time spent by the non-recursive process is a lot less; it takes longer in wall-clock time only because it&#8217;s waiting on disk I/O.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to try another technique for non-recursive make that doesn&#8217;t set the <code>VPATH</code> for each source directory. Unfortunately, this is going to involve some changes to the dependency system (which I don&#8217;t understand very well), so I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;m going to find the time.</p>
<p>My technique involved the use of the <code>$(eval)</code> makefile function, which is only available in gmake 3.80 or higher. The tests were performed under MSYS, using GNU make 3.81, available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&#038;package_id=82724">MSYS snapshots</a>. Special thanks to Earnie Boyd for patiently dealing with me and pointing me at the right files.

<p>The <a href="http://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a> has been good for open source.  In my time there I learned about what makes open source tick, and that it&#8217;s not some mysterious cloud of elitist developers, but rather a group of people just like you and me who work hard everyday to keep things going and end up doing extraordinary things.  Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://mozilla.com/">where I work now</a>&#8230; <img src="http://morgamic.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>So it wasn&#8217;t hard to <a href="http://morgamic.com/wp-rss2.php?cat=8">join the Rackathon</a> and donate some bucks to help support all of the projects they host.  It&#8217;s the least I can do.  If you enjoy the <a href="http://osuosl.org/hosting/clients">projects they host</a>, send some money their way and help support them.</p>

<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I recently went round for dinner with some friends I haven't seen for about five years. Conversation turned to my job and I mentioned that I worked for the Mozilla Foundation. "Firefox? We've got that, but we never really use it. Why's it better?" </p>

<p>I went to their laptop PC, balanced on the sofa in the corner of the lounge, and showed them about tabs, and how it makes browsing so much more pleasant. (I couldn't show them middle-click, as the laptop didn't have a middle mouse button.) They seemed only mildly impressed.</p>

<p>Next, I moved on to the addons system. Trying to find something that would appeal, I went to addons.mozilla.org and started looking through the "Most Popular" list. However, everything on offer suddenly seemed incredibly geeky and irrelevant to their lives. Web Developer Toolbar? Nope. FlashGot? Get real.</p>

<p>Then we scrolled past <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/398/">ForecastFox</a>. Now, my view of weather is that it's something you dress for, not something you obsess about, and so this extension has never been of interest. But when I explained it, their eyes lit up. Somewhat bemused, I installed it (incidentally, ForecastFox's UI for telling it your location is far too complicated). They thought that having three little weather symbols in the status bar was was the coolest thing since sliced bread, and said they'd be using Firefox from then on!</p>

<p>It just goes to show, you can hook people on Firefox with the strangest things ...</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/weirdal/archives/017015.html">Santa Cruz loves two-wheeled transport...</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>On Monday morning at about midnight, I wandered outside my apartment for a quick break before going to bed.  My bicycle, with trailer, was parked and locked outside.  Nine hours later, after getting updated on my e-mail and showering, I wandered towards my apartment door, and noticed the rear tire of my trailer wasn't visible...</p>

<p>Sure enough, the bike and trailer had been stolen.  This prompted some uncivil language at uncivil volumes and lengths...  Basically, I was out $700.00 and had no hope of seeing it again.</p>

<p>Until I received a call Thursday afternoon (today) from the Santa Cruz Police Department.</p>

<p>When I purchased the bicycle several months ago, the first thing I did with it was get a bicycle license, registering it with the City of Santa Cruz.  That foresight paid off when the City recovered my bicycle in a nearby park on Tuesday - minus trailer, and with some minor damage when the thieves ripped off the trailer, but serviceable.  It's in the bike shop now, where I asked the team there to give it "the works", repairing any damage that had been done.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm quite happy to have the bicycle back, even damaged.  What surprised me was that the thieves made no attempt to remove the license stickers or the serial number on the bike.  It was quite obvious they cared only about the trailer, from the damage.</p>

<p>Since I'm moving again in two weeks, I've decided not to bring the bicycle back to my current place.  This was the second bicycle trailer I've had stolen from me here.  I have no wish to tempt fate or any low-life bastard scum again.</p>

<p>All too often, when you hear about a local city government or its police department, it's usually bad news.  This is one case where the City of Santa Cruz, and the Santa Cruz Police Department, did everything right, and did me a fantastic service.  My deepest gratitude and thanks go out to them, in particular Officer Inouye and Officer Goodwin, neither of whom I think I've actually met.</p></p>

<p>
<p>Today, I went to a Council on Foundations meeting in San Francisco on &#8220;How to host a Summit&#8221;.  You can read more about the Council on Foundations <a title="Council on Foundations" href="http://www.cof.org/Council/?ItemNumber=4009">here</a>.  COF provides a lot of resources for corporate and private foundations in the United States regarding issues like event planning, governance guidelines, strategic planning, and networking.  It was a valuable meeting because I observed how many other different, traditional foundations are addressing issues when it comes to planning summits and meetings for their constituents. However, I am not sure how much will apply to what we are doing with Community Giving.  The seminar also reinforced that what we are doing at Mozilla, with both the Community Giving Program and the overall mission of the organizations, is truly unique and different from just about everyone else out there.

<p>
<p>The blogosphere is <a title="Who is blogging about Steve Yegge?" href="http://technorati.com/search/steve-yegge.blogspot.com">alive with mumblings</a> about <a title="Steve Yegge" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a>&#8217;s rants. I haven&#8217;t read them all, but the one I have are, though lengthy, well worth a read. I point you in particular to this one:</p>
<p><a title="Dreaming in Browser Swamp" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/bloggers-block-3-dreaming-in-browser.html"> Blogger&#8217;s Block #3: Dreaming in Browser Swamp</a></p>
<p>Some real gems in there:</p>
<blockquote><p>It turns out if you dig deep into Mozilla (aka Netscape, aka Firefox, aka SeaMonkey, aka SwampMonster, I mean the thing really has way too many farging names already), you&#8217;ll find that it actually <em>is</em> a relatively full-featured platform. It&#8217;s not quite as general-purpose as an OS (or Java), but it&#8217;s certainly big and hairy enough to be making threats in that general direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>We hear you brother, but wait&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;my God, it&#8217;s <em>sooooooo</em> ugly. It&#8217;s got well over a decade of ugly packed in there. &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; in Mozilla is six or seven files in as many different languages. I kid you not. It&#8217;s worse than Hello, World was back in the Petzold days of Win32 programming. You have your XUL file and your JavaScript file and your CSS file and your manifest.rdf and your i18n.something and I can&#8217;t remember what all else. And then you have to build them together (using some <em>other</em> files) to make even <em>more</em> files: a JAR file and an XPI file at a minimum.  That&#8217;s one gnarly-ass introductory program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we feel your pain. It&#8217;s a bit unfair to compare a Hello World extension to printing on the console in Python. Try building Hello World in QT or GTK and packaging it up into something usable. It&#8217;s a good point though. In the age of Web Applications, all that work seems laborious  for the developer compared with uploading a PHP script. And end users are getting used to not installing anything any more.</p>
<p>There is always a bright side however. On JavaScript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">For one thing, despite JavaScript&#8217;s inevitable quirks and flaws and warts and hairy boogers and severe body odor, it possesses that magical property that you can get stuff done really fast with it. Well, if you can find any halfway decent tools and libraries for it, that is. Which you can&#8217;t, not without effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on it goes, taking digs at other technologies and how things are less than ideal in the browser programming world. Regardless, Mozilla and Firefox did breathe new life into the Web programming that really set the scene for the quest to make things nicer for all of us.

<p>
<p>Now that it seems that Firefox 2 developer documentation is &#8220;done&#8221; (in that there&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s immediately in need of doing, to my knowledge), I&#8217;m moving on to other tasks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked on dev.planning if there&#8217;s any developer documentation needed for Thunderbird 2, but there&#8217;s been no response on that yet, so for now I&#8217;ll assume there isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to get myself into work on my first &#8220;extension dissection&#8221; article, where I take an existing third-party extension and show how it works, but I&#8217;m having trouble picking the extension I want to pull apart.  Nothing&#8217;s really grabbing me, shaking me violently, and saying, &#8220;Dude, dissect me!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve started attending the Gran Paradiso (Firefox 3) meetings, so I can start becoming aware of what&#8217;s going on there, since that&#8217;ll be the next major documentation effort.</p>
<p>I have several other documents I plan to write or update, and of course there&#8217;s always twiddling needed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to think.  This is the first time&#8230; ever&#8230; I think, that I&#8217;ve been involved in documenting a product where we actually finished the docs before the product went out the door.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s still tons of documentation to write.  Which is why we&#8217;re looking for a new tech writer to add to the devrel team.  Know any good ones?

<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>So Win32 has these two different types of bitmaps, right? DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps, basically in-memory bitmaps that you can scribble directly to) and DDBs (Device Depenednt Bitmaps, that you can&#8217;t scribble directly to the bits to, managed by the OS/driver, usually faster, etc.).</p>

<p>How do you create a DIB?  You call CreateDIBSection.  How do you create a DDB given a bunch of bits?  Why, you call CreateDIBitmap.  See, CreateDIBitmap takes a bunch of bits and returns a DDB.  CreateDIBSection, on the other hand, creates a DIB.  As Stuart put it, I hope someone got fired over that API name.</p>

<p>Note: this wasn&#8217;t some snafu about DDB vs. DIB; we were doing the intended thing, I just spent like 15 minutes staring at some code trying to figure out what was going before remembering that particular API naming decision.</p>

<p>I had a productive call today with Aaron Leventhal, the module owner of Mozilla&#8217;s accessibility efforts.  We talked about the various ways that the Giving Program might support an effort like accessibility.  Aside from just providing things like hardware to volunteers, we will sponsor part of the meet-up that the accessibility team will be having in mid-October.  This is another example of how Community Giving can give back to our volunteer contributors.  Even if it is just paying for something like the meals at a get-together, we are happy to consider.  Other groups, like the members of the Camino volunteer group, have responded about meet-ups and we are finding ways to work together.  If you have an idea, please email me.

<h4><a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=6">Meet “The Shavers”</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I’ve just returned from our third guest lecture on Mozilla development.  Today we had Mike Shaver, and, since she’s still on vacation, Tyla came too—it was a family affair.  Last night on IRC, in between Shaver’s comments (nay, abuse) about my incorrect use of the subjunctive, the students and I hammered out a <a href="http://cs1.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Mozilla-Seneca_Projects_QA">list of questions</a> for him to tackle.  Now that the <a href="http://cs1.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Project_List">class projects</a> are rolling, it was a great chance to ask someone with such breadth and depth of Mozilla about pieces important to them.  We heard about testing, ideas for Linux integration, thoughts on OS X keychain, and distcc msvc progress, to name a few.  And all of it in that typical understated stand-up comedian style Mike is so good at.</p>
<p>I think one of the most interesting and successful pieces was Shaver’s demonstration of how he uses <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org">lxr</a>.  He took a simple example—adding a bookmark—and showed how he would progressively work his way down through the code in order to find the particular function he was after.  It’s the kind of archeological task for which there is no manual (if I’m wrong about this, feel free to email me the URL!).  The only way to acquire this knowledge is through participation in the oral tradition, and having access to a great storyteller like Mike.</p>
<p>One of the things Shaver discussed at length was the value of the million little pieces that go into making the larger whole that is Mozilla.  The students are starting to understand this, and realizing that they can find success in their own areas of interest.  A great example of this is Erin, who came to me yesterday trying to find a project related to accessibility.  Not an hour later I had mail from Aaron Leventhal with ideas for points of entry and encouragement to get her started.  It wouldn’t be possible for Erin or the other students to succeed without the interest and support of the community—something I’m glad to be able to rely upon.</p>
<p>I’ve been getting a fair bit of email asking when we’ll have the lectures available on-line.  The answer is soon, but not yet.  We’re in the process of digitizing and editing the different cameras, audio, and screencasts into final products.  I’ll announce when they do become available so that everyone on the interweb can enjoy what we’re experiencing live.  Until then, many thanks to Shaver for this and all the other million things he’s helping me do.

<h4><a href="http://www.daveliebreich.com/blog/?p=111">Updates on the testing front</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/User:AxelHecht">Axel Hecht</a> <a href="news://news.mozilla.org:119/N4Odnd9RRaYEioXYnZ2dnUVZ_s6dnZ2d@mozilla.org">posted</a> in mozilla.dev.quality some good ideas about extension-based test harnesses.  I especially like the logging to the console and registering a console listener idea.  I hope someone, maybe even me, can work on these ideas soon.</p>

<p>dietrich and rsayre are working on porting places test cases to the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/SoftwareTesting:Tools:SimpleXulTestHarness">xpcshell-simple test harness</a>.  See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354401">bug 354401</a>.  I heard they were discussing the philosophy of naming test functions, too.</p>

<p>waldo took the simple http server functionality that was embedded in the necko tests, fortified it, and packaged it to run as a stand-alone extension/component.  He&#8217;s in the process of landing the changes in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342877">bug 342877</a>.  He packaged a spike of it for me to try with jsunit.  It works fine, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing other cool uses of this server in testing.</p>

<p>rhelmer checked in a bunch of enhancements to the update checker script (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346013">bug 346013</a>).  But he&#8217;s not done - more changes are coming to add additional automated verifications to the build process.  This is really cool, since problems detected during that process are problems QA won&#8217;t trip over (forcing a respin and a restart of testing).</p>

<p>Thanks to some cribbing from config files created by bhearsum at seneca, I got buildbot running as a master on my MacBook Pro, and a buildslave running on WinXP (on Parallels, on my MBP) building firefox on trunk.  <em>AND</em> running &#8220;make check&#8221; with log-file scanning to detect test failures.  I&#8217;m planning to get jsunit, dbaron&#8217;s reftest, and some of the extension-based test harness stuff running as well.</p>

<p>Why buildbot?  Well, I wanted to learn more about it.  And I wanted to get something running without waiting on tinderbox machine config or tinderbox client code changes.  And all I really want is to turn a tree orange if a test fails (which buildbot can do).  And it&#8217;s shiny.</p></p>

<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I just finished instrumenting the win32 cairo backend to gather some statistics on what operations we&#8217;re actually calling.  The dataset is pretty small since it&#8217;s late and I can only click on random links for so long<sup>*</sup>, but the results are interesting anyway.  So:</p>

<pre>
 total ops: 35026
                                 24-24  24-32  32-24  32-32

           over_aligned_nomask:   4338      0  16793    410
       source_unaligned_nomask:      0      0      0      0
         over_unaligned_nomask:    153      0    145      0
                  source_solid:      0      0      0     19
               source_gradient:      0      0      0      0
         source_surface_extend:    910      0   3061      0
          source_surface_image:    273      0   1346   1097
                      other_op:      0      0      0      0
               with_solid_mask:     42      0   1107      0
               with_other_mask:      0      0      0      0
</pre>

<p>(24-32 means 24-bit RGB source to 32-bit RGBA destination).  This reveals some interesting numbers; by far the most common operation is a 32-bit ARGB integer-aligned no-mask blit to a 24-bit RGB surface, with the OVER blending operation.  We&#8217;re handling GIF and PNG images as full ARGB, so this makes sense, though it still seems very high.  The next highest was RGB->RGB blits, with both SOURCE and OVER (which are identical operations with RGB source and dest).  The good news is that, in theory, both of these opeartions are accelerated; the first with AlphaBlend, and the second with BitBlt.  We&#8217;re hitting non-integer-aligned blits in a few cases; I don&#8217;t know why, but these are relatively slow.  Leaving that aside, there are two obvious optimizations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We&#8217;re hitting the operation with an image surface (non-win32-wrapped, just a raw chunk of pixels) quite a bit; this is the source_surface_image number.  We can handle RGB-RGB with StretchDIBits, without needing to do a bunch of copying like the fallback code will do, but ARGB-RGB will be trickier.  We can still wrap the bits directly without copying; at worst, we should do the blend in-place if the destination is a memory context.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#8217;re hitting the operation with a surface source, with extend set to something other than None, presumably Repeat.  We can handle this for RGB-RGB with PatBlt, but again, ARGB-RGB becomes trickier.  I&#8217;m not sure what the solution is for ARGB-RGB here, especially with OVER.  (If SOURCE, we can use PatBlt again and pretend the alpha channel isn&#8217;t there.)  This is further complicated by a lot of these alpha channels really being 1-bit alpha; MaskBlt can&#8217;t repeat, though we could concievably turn this into a whole bunch of MaskBlt operations.  Or, we could execute fallback directly on the bits if possible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I plan on implementing these in the next week or two, though I think that overall, text rendering dominates gfx in any profile.</p>

<p>The other thing that we need to figure out is whether the GDI operations are really all that fast.  A lot depends on the video card driver; most of the time, we&#8217;re working with bitmap memory contexts, so we can take advantage of software-only functions here if they&#8217;re faster.  &#8220;Faster&#8221; is tricky to define, though; in some cases, we <em>can</em> get faster, by using up 100% CPU, or we can get slightly slower, but use 0% CPU (since the hardware does it all).  MMX/SSE/etc. optimized functions could end up being faster than a poorly written video card driver&#8217;s functions.  It&#8217;s hard to benchmark those, but even with that, we could easily have some sort of runtime rendering selection based on a user&#8217;s particular system.</p>

<p><sup><em></em></sup> I stopped there for a second and went and told Dan about an awesome idea for an extension to randomly click links for you for testing purposes (I know that as I write this, someone will already say that they&#8217;ve done it, but my quick 2 second google didn&#8217;t find it, though now that I looked *harder</p> I found Anchorun on AMO, which works fine with 3.0 as long as the maxVersion is bumped, but <em>anyway</em>)&#8230; so he&#8217;s hacking on it which will give us a good testbed for metrics gathering and other work.

<h4><a href="http://djst.org/blog/2006/09/27/the-name-firefox-not-allowed-in-ubuntu/">The Name “Firefox” Not Allowed In Ubuntu?</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>There are lots of ongoing discussions in the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu Forums</a> about the <a href="http://ze-dinosaur.livejournal.com/12083.html">fact</a> that Mozilla has asked Debian to either comply with the trademarks/copyrights and use both the Firefox logo and name, and let all their patches run through Mozilla, or to neither use the logo nor the name. A typical <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1541539&#038;postcount=16">forum post</a>, written by <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=43213">Bnonn</a>, quoted here:</p>
<blockquote><p>This seems entirely insensible to me. Mozilla is basically stating that they would rather Debian (and, by derivation, Ubuntu) pretend that Firefox isn&#8217;t Firefox, than use Firefox with a different logo.</p>
<p>Now, personally I hate the damn blue globe and wish that Debian/Ubuntu could use the proper Firefox icon. It confounds me that Mozilla would make the icon non-free, thereby limiting its brand recognition and achieving absolutely nothing (what are they afraid of for crying out loud?) But surely even the blue globe with the name &#8220;Firefox&#8221; underneath it is better than a blue globe (or something better) with the name IceWeasel, or Freefox? It sounds like Mozilla is cutting off its nose to spite its face&#8212;which is particularly dumb given that, firstly, the &#8220;fix&#8221; is just a farce; secondly, it&#8217;s a non-issue anyway! And thirdly, the Debian and Ubuntu communities are big, idealistic, and outspoken, and will surely react with ill-will. I can&#8217;t see how that won&#8217;t harm Mozilla <em>far</em> more than any perceived benefit they&#8217;ll get.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s simply that, in order to keep their trademark, they <em>have</em> to get Debian to comply (by law, if they don&#8217;t, they lose the trademark). But it seems like they should really consider adjusting their copyright requirements. <em>All</em> they&#8217;d have to do to resolve this whole issue is open-source an <em>icon!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The truth is, however, that Mozilla Corporation&#8217;s aggressive defending of their copyright <em>is</em> sensible. There is (at least) one strong reason why Mozilla <em>must</em> defend their copyrighted name and logo, and that is quality assurance. If anyone were allowed to make their own highly modified version of the browser and for example bundle it with spyware, and on top of that still call it Firefox with the recognized fox-around-globe logo, then people would no longer associate Firefox with high quality. People would eventually associate Firefox with spyware and viruses, which is the opposite of the reputation Mozilla is trying to build. The only way to maintain Mozilla&#8217;s strong quality and security reputation is to make sure anything named Firefox really <em>is</em> Firefox.</p>
<p>Of course, one could argue that anything that leaves Debian is probably going to retain the quality of the original authors (Mozilla contributors), and Mozilla Corporation could probably legally make an exception to allow Debian to use the name Firefox even though they don&#8217;t use the copyrighted logo which Debian will never use. I am, however, not a lawyer, so I don&#8217;t know the effect on the copy/trademark rights if such an exception was made.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As Dennis Kaarsemaker says in the <a href="http://djst.org/blog/2006/09/27/the-name-firefox-not-allowed-in-ubuntu/#comment-295">first comment</a> of this blog post, Debian&#8217;s <acronym title="Debian Free Software Guidelines">DFSG</acronym> makes a legal exception from Mozilla worthless. In other words, Debian has to a large part itself to blame for this dilemma.

<p>Mozilla
Thunderbird 1.5.0.8 has (not yet) been released. Release
notes are (not yet) available. This post lists the
improvements in Thunderbird 1.5.0.8 over 1.5.0.7. This list encompasses
almost every single known fix that went
into
this release. Do check out the known
issues as
well.</p>
<p>The Gecko 1.8.0.x branch (Thunderbird 1.5.0.x series) will
only bring stability and security bug fixes. As such, no new features
will be added.
</p>
<p>Impact key for security issues listed on the Mozilla
Foundation Security Advisories webpage: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span>Critical</span>:
Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install software,
requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.</li>
  <li><span>High</span>:
Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data from sites in other
windows or inject data or code into those sites, requiring no more than
normal browsing actions.</li>
  <li>Moderate: Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or
Critical except they <span>only
work in uncommon
non-default configurations</span> or require the user to
perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.</li>
  <li>Low: Minor
security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service attacks, minor data
leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of SSL indicia would have "High"
impact because those are generally used to steal sensitive data
intended for other sites.)</li>

<h4><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2006/09/26/better-metrics-for-security-understanding-the-symantec-internet-security-threat-report/">Better Metrics for Security - Understanding the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Symantec Internet Security Threat Report came out yesterday.  Of all the metrics that they are using, number of vulnerabilities gets top billing.  This is possibly because this concept is easiest for people to understand:  Count up the number of bugs.  Product with the least bugs is declared to be more secure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is, of course, much more complex than that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Looking at the number of vulnerabilities does not tell you much at all.  The number of bugs that are counted for a commercial product is the number of bugs that are reported externally and fixed in a security update. Any bugs that are found through the QA process or by vendors engaged to find security vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs or in major product revisions.  It makes sense for a commercial vendor to do it this way since those fixes will get the benefit of the longer test pass.  Those bugs do not appear in security updates are not included in the overall count.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At Mozilla, you can see all of our bugs.  The process is open, by design.  You see the bugs found by internal testing and those reported to us externally, everything.  Just counting up the number of bugs between products will never be an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing is secure.  If all software has vulnerabilities, then the most important metric is really how long it takes the vendor to fix a bug once it is identified.  That’s the measure of how long the user is at risk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The report does talk about days of risk (they call it “time to patch,”) but it’s deep in the analysis sections, not in the summary.  The highlights only mention the number of vulnerabilities and that’s the easiest story for the press to run.  If you look at the other metrics you begin to get a much clearer picture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On “time to patch”:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="apple-style-span"><span>The time period between the disclosure date of a vulnerability and the release date of an associated patch is known as the “time to patch.” If exploit code is created and made public during this time, computers may be immediately vulnerable to widespread attack. It should be noted that this metric includes all patched vulnerabilities affecting the browser, regardless of their severity. During the current reporting period, Apple Safari had an average patch development time average of five days, up from zero days in the second half of 2005 (figure 22).76 In the first six months of 2006, Microsoft had an average patch development time of ten days for Internet Explorer vulnerabilities, down from the 25 days in the second half of 2005. </span><span class="apple-style-span"><span>Between January and June 2006, Mozilla had an average patch development time of three days, slightly lower than the five-day average during the second half of 2005.</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span> During this reporting period, Opera had an average patch development time of two days. In the second half of 2005, it was 18 days.</span><span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On “windo<span class="apple-style-span"><span></span>w of exposure”:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="apple-style-span"><span>The window of exposure is the difference in days between the time at which exploit code affecting a vulnerability is made public and the time at which the affected vendor makes a patch available to the public for that vulnerability.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="apple-style-span"><span>And…</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="apple-style-span"><span>In the first half of 2006, Internet Explorer had a window of exposure of ninedays, down considerably from 25 days in the second half of 2005 (figure 4). Apple Safari had a window of</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span> </span><span class="apple-style-span"><span>exposure of five days, up from zero days in the second half of 2005.12</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span> </span><span class="apple-style-span"><span>In the first half of 2006, Opera had a window of exposure of two days, down considerably from 18 days</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span> </span><span class="apple-style-span"><span>during the second half of 2005. </span><span class="apple-style-span"><span>In the first half of this year, Mozilla had a window of exposure of one day. In the second half of 2005, Mozilla had a window of exposure of negative two days, meaning that exploit code in that period was generally released after patches were available.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Looking at “time to patch” and “window of exposure” you begin to see the real success story for Mozilla security.  We’re able to keep the time to patch so low because of the incredible contributions of the Mozilla community.  Every time you run nightly builds you are creating a more secure web experience for millions and millions of people.</p>

<p>I've been reading the 10th edition of Symantec's Internet Security Threat Report (<a href="http://www.symantec.com/specprog/threatreport/ent-whitepaper_symantec_internet_security_threat_report_x_09_2006.en-us.pdf" hreflang="en">PDF downlad</a>), and I thought I could share with my twelve readers <strong>my own</strong> initial thoughts...</p>


<p>After a quick read, two items come to mind:</p>


<ol>
<li>Firefox is still leading the pack by fixing security bugs quickly (see page 14), which is the demonstration of how committed is Mozilla in addressing security issues in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>The report has improved over the last edition by taking into account the "Window of exposure", which is a better way to assess security than just counting reported security bugs. It's not yet perfect (who is?), but it's better.</li>
</ol>

<p>On this last topic, see an extract of Symantec's report (emphasis mine):</p>


<blockquote><p>For the first time, in this volume of the Internet Security Threat Report, Symantec is assessing the window of exposure for Web browsers. In the first half of 2006, Internet Explorer had a window of exposure of nine days, down considerably from 25 days in the second half of 2005 (figure 4). Apple Safari had a window of exposure of five days, up from zero days in the second half of 2005. In the first half of 2006, Opera had a window of exposure of two days, down considerably from 18 days during the second half of 2005. <strong>In the first half of this year, Mozilla had a window of exposure of one day</strong>. In the second half of 2005, Mozilla had a window of exposure of negative two days, meaning that exploit code in that period was generally released after patches were available.</p></blockquote>


<h4>The inherent limits of bug counting</h4>


<p>The central issue is how can we assess browser security? Just counting reported bugs is definitely not enough, and let's try to explain why. The Mozilla project is very transparent in its processes. Therefore, every security-related bug is posted. On the contrary, it is possible for a closed-source vendor to silently fix security bugs. If these bugs are discovered internally, then reports such as Secunia or Symantec won't count them. They did exist, but were not counted. Therefore, counting reported bugs is a method that essentially benefits proprietary vendors on paper.</p>


<p>For example, Mozilla has been working really hard lately in investigating more than ever its security weaknesses, using various means, <a href="http://www.coverity.com/news/nf_news_08_15_06_story_27.html" hreflang="en">including Coverity software</a>. This has led to fixing more bugs than in the past. While it looks like more bugs have been discovered, the actual good news is that they have been discovered <strong>and patched</strong> before they were exploited. In this case, a higher number of fixed bugs is actually good news. If proprietary vendors have used or are investing similar effort, no one will notice, as the fixed bugs will not be reported by Symantec. In this case, transparency, as Mozilla demonstrates, is benefitting the end user, but hurting on the PR front. I'm glad to say that the end user is the priority for Mozilla, even if the cost to pay is explaining over and over why our visible bug count is higher than others, and that it's actually good news (yes, I'm happy to see these bugs fixed!).</p>


<p>There is something that I'd like to see mentioned in future editions of the Symantec report in the future, is the criticality of security issues. Maybe it's just that I missed it, but I did not see any mention in Symantec's latest report. I do think that security issues are not created equal, as some of them are more severe than the others. This is a mitigating factor in terms of security. We should note that non-critical issues need to be addressed too, as they may become critical down the road, being combined with similar faults. I've heard Window Snyder (Chief Security Something at Mozilla) explaining that Mozilla is committed in fixing all issues, even if they are not critical. And she is right!</p>


<p>In order to conclude, I'd like to quote Symantec once again, as I understand that fixing browser bugs is nothing if people don't use the latest version:</p>


<blockquote><p>In order to protect against Web browser attacks, Symantec advises users and administrators to upgrade all browsers to the latest, patched versions.</p></blockquote>


<p>Well said!</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://robert.accettura.com/archives/2006/09/25/in-search-of-the-missing-sync/">In Search Of The Missing Sync?</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I  had another silly thought this evening, and thought I&#8217;d just mention it for anyone interested.  I&#8217;ve been reading through some bugs, and <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla2:Device_Sync">wiki</a> documents on the state of synchronization of various devices with Mozilla based products.</p>
<p>It would be great to have a generic XPCOM wrapper for interacting with Bluetooth support on various platforms (yes, you read that right, and trust me it&#8217;s not that crazy).  It would need to have the ability to detect what Bluetooth implementation is used by the user for Windows (<a href="http://broadcom.com/products/bluetooth_support_btw_dk.php">Broadcom/WIDCOMM</a> vs. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/bluetooth/bluetooth/bluetooth_start_page.asp">Windows XP</a>), <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cgi-bin/search.pl?q=bluetooth+sdk&#038;num=10&#038;site=default_collection">Apple&#8217;s Bluetooth implementation</a> and of course Linux (I believe it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">Bluez</a>, but I&#8217;m not to familiar with Bluetooth on Linux).  Note that this <em>does not</em> mean having Mozilla drivers for Bluetooth hardware.  Just an easy way for developers to interact with Bluetooth without the concept of platform specific software.</p>
<p>With projects like <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:Lightning">Lightning</a>, Thunderbird maturing, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/">MiniMo</a> it&#8217;s important to be able to interact with other devices for the sake of forward progress, and this may prove to be the best solution for many cases.</p>
<p>There are several approaches to device sync from what I&#8217;ve seen from things that are device specific like<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Thunderbird_:_FAQs_:_PalmSync">PalmSync</a> to the more generic <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/">iSync</a>, but the problem that comes up is that it&#8217;s a lot of work for relatively limited devices.  For example, even with iSync, as robust as it is, your still limited in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/devices.html">devices it supports</a>, and it&#8217;s Mac only (leaving Windows and Linux users in the cold).   Others still require commercial software (Palm) to work with iSync.  So for all the work, all Windows users have no benefit from iSync support.  For all the effort on PalmSync for Windows done thus far (and that&#8217;s a fair amount of effort), no Mac users have been able to benefit thus far.  <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/affiliates/syncml/syncmlindex.html">SyncML</a> has some potential, but the lack of support thus far still leaves many without any support.  Anyone without a newer device likely won&#8217;t ever have SyncML support, so again the problem is a limited device set.  And still not all newer devices support SyncML, and it could even depend on your service provider, as they sometimes disable features.</p>
<p>The advantage of Bluetooth is standardization.  Lets face it, love it or hate it Bluetooth is becoming more and more available.  More and more portable devices are shipping with it.  By having support for it, Mozilla products gain compatibility with devices as they come out.  It also would provide good device support over multiple platforms.  For example, Thunderbird&#8217;s Address Book could have a small database of device types (phone/PDA models) and the format of an address book they support (such as vCard) or Calendar (vCalendar or iCal). </p>
<p>It looks like Synchronization Profile (SYNC) and File Transfer Profile (<acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym>) would be necessary to get most devices going (seems not all support SYNC, so supporting <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> would allow you to at least dump your Address Book or just an Address Book card from time to time onto your phone.</p>
<p>If included with Firefox, there would be an easy way for product developers, and extension developers to add a &#8220;send with Bluetooth&#8221; menu option.  Save snippets of a web page, an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t work for every device (such as the iPod thus far which is Bluetooth free, but I&#8217;ve <a href="http://mozpod.mozdev.org">got you covered</a> on that <img src="http://robert.accettura.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), but it&#8217;s a big gain with supporting 1 protocol.</p>
<p>I could even see this as an interesting approach to keeping bookmarks in sync.  Perhaps store your bookmark file on your cell phone&#8230; well you get the picture, mobile devices are without question the future, the question we need to ask is, how do we transport data back and forth?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like something I&#8217;m personally up to implementing (I&#8217;m not very strong when it comes to this stuff), but it would be pretty cool to see someone take on.  The key to this is that it needs to support SYNC and <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym>, as well as be as multi-platform as possible.  That&#8217;s not an easy task, but the possibilities are rather impressive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious what others think of such an idea.  I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s 100% workable, or warrantied for any particular use.  Just some idea in my head I felt like putting into text and sending down the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClkE64nFDY">series of tubes</a> we call the internet.

<p>Our beloved server 'rodan' suffered a hardware failure over the weekend, causing <a href="http://litmus.mozilla.org">Litmus</a> and <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org">Planet</a> to grind to a crashing halt. Planet is back up and running, and thanks to Aravind, Litmus has been migrated over to a spiffy new VM that goes by the slightly less spiffy name of 'dm-litmus01'. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Litmus is only partially up and running at this point. The migration to a new server broke a lot of things, and I'm working on the ever so enjoyable process of untangling an intertwined mass of problems, one at a time. Right now, some basic functionality is available--you're able to access Litmus and view testcases--but you won't be able to login or submit results. </p>

<p>I am working on restoring full functionality as soon as possible, and I thank you all for your patience. Updates will be posted as functionality is restored.</p></p>

<p>
<div><p>This is my report on activities of the <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org/">Mozilla
Foundation</a> for the week ending
September 22, 2006.</p>

<h2>Projects for the week</h2>

<p>Here's a partial listing of what I and others at the Foundation did
this past week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Grants and related topics.  I concluded arrangements for a
Foundation grant to <a href="http://www.senecac.on.ca/">Seneca College</a> (of Toronto Canada) to
support their Mozilla-related activities; you can read more about
these activities on <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/">David Humphrey's blog</a>.</p>

<p>Next action(s): Sort out administrative arrangements for one more
project we're planning to fund.</p></li>
<li><p>IP-related issues. I worked some more on trademark applications; our
goal is to have applications for all word marks and logos
associated with the main products of the project (not just for
Firefox and Thunderbird).</p>

<p>Next action(s): Initiate application for the SeaMonkey logo after
any needed paperwork gets done.</p></li>
<li><p>Conferences. Gerv Markham and Zak Greant participated in
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/">EuroOSCON</a> and <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/eurofoo06/index.cgi">EuroFoo</a>.</p>

<p>Next action(s): Maybe Gerv and/or Zak will blog about this?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Upcoming activities</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Zak Greant will be attending the <a href="http://www.governmentciosummit.ca/">Government CIO Summit</a> in Ottawa
on September 28.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to personal commitments I'll miss the Mozilla weekly call today.</p></li>

<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working off and on for the past few months on implementing a new graph server to replace the ugly graphs that build-graphs generates for tinderbox performance data.  It&#8217;s finally set up somewhere public, and is updating its data frequently from the latest builds; you can play with it at <a rel="tag" target="_new" href="http://graphs.mozilla.org">graphs.mozilla.org</a>.  The tinderboxen aren&#8217;t pushing data directly to it yet, so the data only gets updated once per hour&#8230; but they will be soon.</p>

<p>Dan has a patch to make &#8220;Link to this graph&#8221; work (it doesn&#8217;t right now), and he&#8217;s added support for baselines that will show up when you select a test that has baseline data available.  Bonsai integration is almost complete, so that you&#8217;ll be able to see checkins directly on the graph.  This should make it easier to examine performance regressions caused by checkins.  In the future, the plan is to support arbitrary annotations on the graph, much like you can star a tinderbox build with information.</p>

<p>Any bugs/suggestions should go into bugzilla, in the Webtools -> Graph Server component (which should be created sometime today).</p>

<p>Note: if you get an error about getdata.cgi, wait a few minutes and try again; this most likely means that the update process is pulling new data, and this process keeps the db locked for a few minutes at a time.</p>

<h4><a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/archives/2006/09/25/113/">browser needs more speed</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last little while more or less hacking cairo, part of getting ready to merge the latest cairo source into the Mozilla tree.  I&#8217;ve pushed our win32 changes back into cairo proper, and am just waiting for roc&#8217;s clip-getters patch to become finalized to finally do the merge and get us synced up with cairo.  I&#8217;ve also checked in my Quartz back-end for cairo; there are some significant performance gains to be had, but it&#8217;s not too bad as it is.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve taken the agg surface work that Eric Hielscher started for summer of code and spent a bit reworking it and getting it into shape.  This is a full backend for cairo implemented on top of <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/">Antigrain</a>, another 2D compositing engine.  The agg API is fairly complex; it&#8217;s more like a build-your-own-2D-rendering-engine kit, with a few dozen little pieces that you can glue together to get results.  It&#8217;s pretty neat, but can be hard to work with.  I&#8217;ve almost got everything working now &#8212; the only exception is the mask() operation, for which I have some code written, but no full success yet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the massive speedup that I was hoping for over pixman hasn&#8217;t materialized.  Some things certainly are faster; for example, bilinear image scaling is about 25% faster for upscaling.  Most things are about the same, with some things slightly slower (and an oddity in path filling &#8212; filling with agg is ending up being exactly 2x the speed of cairo&#8217;s, which leads me to believe that there is a bug going on somewhere).  agg certainly has more options, such as many (and pluggable) image filtering options, support for all the various wrap modes, support for all the PDF color compositing operators, perspective transforms, and all sorts of other stuff.  It&#8217;s probably worth continuing to develop the agg back-end, even though it will probably never become the default cairo fallback/image surface because a) it&#8217;s C++; and b) it makes heavy use of C++ templates (all the combinable bits of the pipeline are done as classes, combined using templates), so the code size hit is pretty significant.  The former is not a problem for using it in Mozilla, but the latter may be.  I&#8217;m hoping that I can get agg performance to at least match pixman performance across the board, so that we at least have the option of using the more complex rendering bits.</p>

<p>Note that this is all without the benefit of any MMX/SSE, which is pretty ridiculous considering that x86 is our 99% platform.  This is for the simple reason that none of us knows MMX programming; there are various patches for agg and pixman both that add some MMX support, though I&#8217;ve never tried the agg ones, and the pixman code uses gcc intrinsics and didn&#8217;t seem to give much of a speedup when I last tried on linux.  Projects like <a href="http://liboil.freedesktop.org/">liboil</a> are unfortunately not useful, because of their dependency on gcc.  Anyone out there dying to write a whole pile of MMX/SSE pixel-pushing code, for both MSVC and gcc?</p>

<p>The more I do this the more I&#8217;m convinced that OpenGL and DirectX are the way to go, and that we should be trying to make this work sooner rather than later.  Especially on Windows, we simply can&#8217;t continue to build on top of GDI; it&#8217;s not only painful, but pretty stupid at this point.  I can&#8217;t find any references to what the situation is like for 2D APIs in Vista &#8212; is there a new high-level 2D C API?  Did GDI+ get accelerated?  I&#8217;ve got a Vista machine, so I guess I can answer those questions myself at some point, but if anyone has any pointers, I&#8217;d appreciate them.  (Yes, I know that Vista uses DirectX; but there&#8217;s a gaping chasm between &#8220;Use DirectX&#8221; and &#8220;Fill this path&#8221;&#8230;)</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.squarefree.com" title="Indistinguishable from Jesse">Jesse Ruderman</a></h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.squarefree.com/2006/09/24/squarefree-succumbs-to-the-digg-effect/">Squarefree succumbs to the Digg effect</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 4pm, I noticed that the content on squarefree.com was missing, and the main page was an empty directory listing.  I ssh'ed to my web server and noticed that the "squarefree.com" directory had been renamed to "squarefree.com_DISABLED_BY_DREAMHOST".  Then I checked my email and saw a message from <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a> support:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I just had to disable your site squarefree.com as it's coming under some
load and spawning countless php processes that are crashing the
webserver.  I wasn't able to figure out exactly what's going on, as
leaving it up for more than a minute pretty much toasts the server.
Please don't re-enable it until you've figured out what's going on, or
disabled any possibly problematic php.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>James</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I jumped into #dreamhost on irc.freenode.net and started looking through my web server logs for suspicious requests.  I was expecting to find that my blog had been DDoSed, perhaps by someone trying to leave comment spam.  Instead, I found a large number of requests for non-existant files, falling into two categories:</p>

<ul>

<li>Requests for favicon.ico, a file that does not exist on my site.  Some of these requests are expected: most browsers with tabs request favicon.ico to display it in the tab bar.  But there were also hundreds of IP addresses that requested nothing but favicon.ico for the entire day, and some requested it many times.  About 100 of these IPs were Internet Explorer users with the Google Toolbar, so apparently I was getting <a href="http://thecoder.blog.com/1057698/">DDoS'ed by a bug in the Google Toolbar</a>.  Another 100 were Firefox users; I haven't figured out why Firefox would request nothing but favicon.ico over and over.</li>

<li>Requests due to people using my <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/htmledit/">Real-time HTML Editor</a> to edit pages that used relative URLs for images, iframes, etc.  One user made dozens of requests for a file named "border=0".  Another user made a request for 14 gif files every time the editor refreshed.  I also saw from referrers that <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Real_Time_HTML_editor">the Real-time HTML Editor had been featured on Digg</a>, greatly increasing its traffic.</li>

</ul>

<p>But why would 404 requests create PHP processes?  Due to a recent change in WordPress, Apache was directing each 404 request to WordPress.  WordPress used to put detailed rules in .htaccess -- for example, it would ask Apache to direct requests for http://www.squarefree.com/2005/ to WordPress using <tt>RewriteRule ^([0-9]{4})/?$</tt>.  But newer versions of WordPress instead ask Apache to send it all requests for nonexistent files.  I imagine this puts less strain on Apache when a site uses lots of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages">WordPress Pages</a>, but it hurts when a site gets lots of 404 requests.  Several months ago, I had instructed WordPress to serve <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/2004/08/22/custom-404-page/">my custom 404 page</a> for these requests, but WordPress still had to do a lot of work to determine that the requests should be treated as 404s.</p>

<p>Once I realized what had happened, and determined that reconfiguring WordPress would be difficult, I did what I could to reduce the number of 404 requests WordPress would have to handle.  I created a tiny favicon.ico file so those requests wouldn't be 404s, and I moved the Real-time HTML Editor onto <a href="http://htmledit.squarefree.com/">its own subdomain</a> so WordPress wouldn't handle the 404s it causes.  My site was only down for 40 minutes, with the Real-time HTML Editor down a little longer while I waited for the new subdomain's DNS to propagate.</p>

<p>Some things DreamHost could have done better:</p>

<ul>
<li>It would have been nice if James had disabled PHP for my domain instead of disabling my site entirely.  <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/pornzilla/">Pornzilla</a> did not need to be down due to PHP problems.</li>
<li>A per-user process limit might have allowed my site to send "503 Service Unavailable" in response to some requests instead of being down entirely.  It would have also prevented my site from causing problems for other sites on the shared server.</li>
<li>Better performance diagnostics would have helped both James and me isolate the problem.  For example, it would have been great to have a list of PHP processes showing the request URL that caused each PHP instance to be triggered, the lifetime of each process, and perhaps some performance information (CPU used, RAM used, number of database requests).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things DreamHost did right:</p>

<ul>
<li>DreamHost allowed me to restore my site myself once I fixed the problems.  All I had to do was rename "squarefree.com_DISABLED_BY_DREAMHOST" back to "squarefree.com".</li>
<li>Knowing about <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/2005/05/02/snapshots-on-dreamhost/">DreamHost's .snapshot feature</a> kept me from panicking about data loss when my site appeared to have disappeared.</li>
<li>The employees in #dreamhost were helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone is wondering: yes, I still <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/2004/12/23/why-i-love-dreamhost/">love DreamHost</a>.</p></p>

<p>Back in Ottawa after a whirlwind week in Mountain View.  Summary of the return trip: Chicago airport is as insane on Saturdays as Fridays, so that&#8217;s right out now.  All future trips will avoid ORD if possible.  Luggage: lost (at ORD, natch), but it managed to catch a later flight and get a cab home within 24hrs.  McDonald&#8217;s: as foul as I remember it being, particularly when you&#8217;re trying to juggle a full Quarter Pounder combo while hauling carry-on and trying to find a seat somewhere near the correct gate.  WiFi: always too expensive.  4 hour layover: not bad considering that the Ottawa flight that was supposed to leave 3 hours before mine ended up leaving at basically the same time.  Could have been worse.  Random rumour has it that there will (someday) be a direct Ottawa > San Jose flight. That would seriously, seriously rule, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p></p>

<p>
<p>In recent post <a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/2006/09/earning-ones-way-out-of-trenches.html">Earning one&#8217;s way out of the trenches</a> <a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/">Matt Asay</a> posits:</p>

<blockquote>
It has become an unspoken for me, and should be a common rule throughout the open source business landscape, that no one should become a commander without first having slogged through the trenches as a private. &#8230; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wise to hire management with no open source experience. Now, given that very few people - management or otherwise - have worked within an open source environment, the best way to achieve this is by making the commanders slog like privates for 6-12 months. A VP of Sales should spend at least six months answering emails, setting up demos, etc. before she assumes she understands the open source sales process, and can effectively lead it.

The point is that in a significantly altered business landscape, the best managers will be those who first understand the alterations. Only then will they be able to lead a team tasked with leveraging these alterations for competitive advantage. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not as easy as reading a book on open source strategy. You must live it.
</blockquote>

<p>Is answering emails, setting up demos, etc. really living on the electronic frontier? Even more, is it actually being in the trenches? For people fond of warfare metaphors, consider this quote from former British soldier Arthur Savage:</p>

<blockquote>My memories are of sheer terror and the horror of seeing men sobbing because they had trench foot that had turned gangrenous. They knew they were going to lose a leg. Memories of lice in your clothing driving you crazy. Filth and lack of privacy. Of huge rats that showed no fear of you as they stole your food rations. And cold deep wet mud everywhere. And of course, corpses. I&#8217;d never seen a dead body before I went to war. But in the trenches the dead are lying all around you. You could be talking to the fellow next to you when suddenly he&#8217;d be hit by a sniper and fall dead beside you. And there he&#8217;s stay for days.</blockquote>

<p>Trenches aside, the gap that Matt speaks of isn&#8217;t caused by a lack of knowledge (or even experience). Most &#8220;outside&#8221; managers I have dealt with who have been grafted into a project are competent people who do their research - they weren&#8217;t brought in because they were failing in the proprietary world.</p>

<p>The gap is one of tribe and passion.</p>

<p>Thinking back about my own troubles with outsider management inside of an Open Source corporation, one of the key troubles was that they just weren&#8217;t of my tribe.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t that they lacked knowledge of the core principles of Free Software and Open Source - it was that they consistently made plans and took actions that that put me in personal conflict with the interests and values various electronic frontier communities that I am a part of.</p>

<p>Outsiders won&#8217;t ever get the true spirit of a community-driven development project unless they participate - unless they go native.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker">Mitchell Baker</a>, CEO of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation">Mozilla Corporation</a>. As a female lawyer a decade senior to many Mozilla community members, she makes an unlikely community leader. Despite this, she is a solidly respected leader for an entire family of projects because she became a part of the tribe - struggling to solve the same issues, voluntarily taking care of them when trouble loomed and being fiercely protective of their shared values and needs.</p>

<p>Want to get Open Source, Free Software, free culture, digital freedom and the rest of the Electronic Frontier? Find some part of it that overlays with your true passions, roll up your sleeves and get to work.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/weirdal/archives/016996.html">The State of the World Wide Web, in my opinion</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<p>
<p>This is a two-part article.  Please bear with me.</p>

<h4>"Why do you keep trying?"</h4>

<p>A few weeks ago, I started asking myself this question about Verbosio.  If you factor in the time I spent on Abacus (and I do), I have been at this off-and-on project for about four years now, with nothing of real value to show for that time.  This is a depressing state of affairs.</p>

<p>I can only answer that question with, "Because there's no tools I know of to do the job better."  Specifically, to give me UI's for editing XML documents with language-specific tools (XUL, XBL, RDF, MathML, XHTML, SVG, etc., etc.).  It was true four years ago, and it's still true now.</p>

<p>Think about it:  how cool would it be to have an application that came, out of the box, with the following options under its File menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Document...
    <ul>
      <li>XHTML</li>
      <li>XUL Window</li>
      <li>XUL Dialog</li>
      <li>XUL Overlay</li>
      <li>XBL 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Document Pack...
    <ul>
      <li>XULRunner Application</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You fill out a simple form, and there it is.  Plus, you have language-specific buttons for editing the document in a given language (XUL), and it's easy to switch to another language (CSS, even though it's not XML).</p>

<p>Or, if you want to add MathML, you drop in a MathML extension, and restart... and MathML is now enabled for editing.</p>

<p>Right now, I still don't know of any tools that can really do this.  I've always intended Verbosio as a platform for doing this.  After four years, though, I begin to lose faith, encouraged only by the fact that I perceive a real need for it.</p>

<h4>The WWW is not living up to its (literary) potential</h4>

<p>Many people blame Internet Explorer for this.  Yes, it still has a monopoly stranglehold on browsing the Internet, and yes, IE7 is bringing <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/weirdal/archives/016936.html">some improvements, but not enough</a>.  But those who blame IE and Microsoft alone <strong>are only looking at a small piece of the problem</strong>.</p>

<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee believes we need a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>, and I'm not entirely sure I disagree with him on that.  But even so, this doesn't address other problems with the Web we have now, including the focus of this article.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium has put out dozens of Recommendations, many of them talking about XML languages such as those mentioned above.  XML is a Big Thing, and not going anywhere.  What we can do with XML, and specifically certain XML languages, is truly astonishing.</p>

<p>Creating XML documents with those languages in the first place, though...</p>

<p>Fundamentally, that's what Verbosio is about.  Sure, tools for generating HTML are everywhere, and it's relatively easy to convert HTML to XHTML most of the time.  But what about MathML, or SVG at the same time?  RDF?  How can you create the content flexibly through a GUI?</p>

<p>(Note:  Please spare me the snide remarks suggesting a text editor.  Text editors are just about the most inefficient way to create XML markup that there is.)</p>

<p>The simple fact is, <strong>tools to create such rich XML markup are not widely known and available.</strong>  I truly and honestly believe this holds the WWW in the year 2000 more than Microsoft and Internet Explorer do.</p>

<p>While browsing the WWW has improved dramatically (Firefox, Opera, Safari, Camino, etc.), and e-mail has had similar improvements (Thunderbird, and forgive me for forgetting the other major e-mail clients out there with frequent releases), that simply means the ability to read the WWW has improved.  No corresponding improvements to writing the WWW have been nearly as widespread.</p>

<p>The old Composer application, as it belonged to Netscape (when Netscape was a real company a decade ago), and later Mozilla, was a critical success at providing HTML editing capability.  I dream of a similarly successful rich XML editor at my fingertips.  <a href="http://rhaptos.org/downloads/editing/etna/">ETNA</a> may be that solution.  Verbosio may be that solution.  Or it may be something else.  Amaya isn't quite that solution, but it's good for its purposes.  A tool allowing me to edit XHTML, MathML, SVG, RDF, etc. simultaneously through a GUI that makes me think I'm editing XHTML, MathML, SVG, RDF, etc. instead of making me think I'm editing vanilla XML, is a tool desperately needed.</p>

<p>I've said before I work for <a href="http://www.manyone.net/">ManyOne Networks</a>, and two of our sponsored projects are <a href="http://www.digitaluniverse.net">the Digital Universe</a> and <a href="http://www.eoearth.org/">the Encyclopedia of Earth</a>.  When you get down to it, though, these sites are about hosting and linking to accurate content.  The better tools there are to edit said content, the better the experiences of our customers will be.  In this respect, it's fortunate for me to work at ManyOne Networks.  They want to offer content and content services, and I want to offer content editing services.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web is a fantastic creation; without it, you'd likely not be reading these words.  But even now, the blogging software I'm using to write this article can't let me easily create artwork.  We can see the artwork just fine.  But no one can appreciate that which has not been drawn.</p>

<p>Until that day comes, I fear even blog articles will be restricted mainly to the realm of hypertext and digital camera pictures.  We can read so much more than we can write that we don't even know what we can read or write.  It really is time to put pen to paper, instead of just reading everyone else's papers which are no more capable than our own.</p></p>

<p>I started working to implement support for <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:Lightning">Lighting</a> (project to integrate Calendar into Thunderbird) to sync with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">Apple iPods</a> via <a href="http://mozpod.mozdev.org">mozPod</a>.  Didn&#8217;t take to long before I had a successful sync.

<p>That&#8217;s right, we now have the ability to sync contacts and calendar to the iPod on Mac/Windows (Linux still on the todo list, though it&#8217;s mostly there).   It will require Thunderbird 1.5 or later.  No release date just yet.</p>
